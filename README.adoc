= Internet Tools W2015 Project

== Intro

This is a website designed for our Internet Tools class. The class involved +HTML+, +CSS+, +PHP+, +Javascript+, +Ruby+... many of the basic building blocks are here, but is was more of a WebDev 101 than an in-depth look at web application development.

== Contents

* Various assignments and labs.
* A small +Flash/JS+ game collection.
* Our final project.
** It's a Cookie Clicker clone, with leaderboards.

== Requirements

+MySQL+, +PHP+, +Apache+... really, just run this on a LAMPS. It'll save you the headache.

== Final Project

We didn't want to implement +Ruby+ so we made the game about collecting Gems by clicking a Ruby.

== What's missing?

The SQL. Uhm.... Good luck!
